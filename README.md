1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
The purpose of my project is to allow users to judge their taste in music through their favorite song's popularity. 

2. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
http://students.washington.edu/royle/info343/spotify-challenge

3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Katrina, Saina

4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
20+ Hours

5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? 
Yes, I ran into a problem where I would try to append an element with angular directives, but it doesn't work. I think it'd be helpful for students to know that.

6. How can we make the challenge better?
To make the challenge better, I think it would be benefitical to go over how to manipulate API data. One of the hardest things was knowing how to manipulate arrays and to get data from them.

I used some of these resources:
